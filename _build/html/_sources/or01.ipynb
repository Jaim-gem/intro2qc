    "In our daily lives, we make a lot of decisions. In fact, the average human being makes around **35 000 decisions** in a day. From small decisions like deciding to take a sip of water, to more deliberate actions like how to reply to a message. What if we knew **exactly** what choices we need to make in order to have the **best day possible**?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a  *special type of calculator* that tells us how optimal our day was. We tell this **calculator** all the decisions we made that day (**input**) and it calculates for us how optimally we spent our day out of 100% (**output**). As itâ€™s calculating it takes into consideration the work we did, the fun we had, the amount of rest we got etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's keep it *simple*. Let's say we want to develop the perfect morning routine that *leads* to the best day ever. For our particular morning routine, there are only 3 decisions to make: (1) the time we get up, (2) our choice of what to drink, and (3) our choice of what to eat for breakfast. \n",
