    "Here are some interesting questions that you can ask yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are bits, physically?**\n",
    "- **What is a computer, actually?**\n",
    "- **What *is* and what *isn't* a computer?**\n",
    "- **Can a molecule be a computer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a conventional definition of a computer for now.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **computer** is an electronic device that processes information (data) to perform specific tasks. It takes input, processes it using instructions (programs), and produces output. Computers are designed to follow precise instructions step by step, making them powerful tools for solving problems, storing data, and automating tasks.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*ChatGPT*\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and Information\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ChatGPT definition, we notice that the words \"information\", \"data\" as well as \"instructions\" are emphasized. We also want to go back to the definition of a *bi* as a “*unit of computational information*”. Some might say it’s the most basic unit of **data**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is **information**  and what is **data**? \n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about it, information is **everywhere**, whether from texts that we read, to audio that we listen to, the photos on our phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data** is a way to record the **state** of something.\n",
    "- **Information** is the *interpretation* of that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have an instrument that measures the intensity of light hitting it. One second, it reads ‘100’, and the other second it reads ‘150’. The **data** are *the assigned numbers*, but the **information** is the *interpretation* of what those numbers represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; \n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical bits\n",
    "\n",
    "So we’ve talked about **bits** as these abstract units of **data** and **information**. But bits are also physical! Digital bits represent the **information** on the **state** of some **physical** object. Here are some examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can read out the voltage of tiny **integrated circuits (ICs)** or the states of **transistors**. If the voltage level is beyond a particular threshold, it is ‘**high’** or `1`,** and if it is below that threshold, it is ‘**low’**  or `0`.  If a **transistor**  is on, it is in `1` state and if it is off, it is in the `0` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hard drive technology** uses magnetic material and reads out the magnetic orientation of defined regions of the material (called **magnetic domains**).\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **CD technology** uses **pits** and **lands** on a **polycarbonate material** to encode information.  In the read out, a **laser** is focussed on the material as there is a difference in the reflection off the pits and the lands. The state `1` is read when there is a change from *pit-to-land* or *land-to-pit*, and a state `0` if there is no change.\n",
    "\n",
    "![transistor](87.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computers \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the knowledge of the state of some physical system represents **information** that may be used for computation really puts things into perspective as to what things can or can’t be considered a **computer.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, a **computer** is anything that is able to do **computation**, i.e. receive input, process the input according to some instructions, and give an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "![comp](86.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of our conventional understanding of a computer, here are *other examples*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedded systems**, e.g. cars, medical devices, wearable technology, home appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, thermostats)\n",
    "- **Analog computers** can use *mechanics* or *hydraulic* properties to compute.\n",
    "- **The brain** because, of course.\n",
    "- **DNA computers** use strands of DNA with the sequence of nucleotides [adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G)] to compute via biochemical reactions. A and T are ‘0’ and C and G are ‘1’.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; \n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, **molecules, chemical** and **biological systems**  might be used for computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a key point here though. Whilst they may be able to process input information and give output, they should also be **programmable**. If we are able to program or manipulate the states of chemical or biological systems fairly well, then they can be used for computation/ \n",
    "\n",
    "The key take-aways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input encoding** \n",
    "2. **Output decoding** \n",
    "3. **Information processing** \n",
    "4. **Programmability**\n",
